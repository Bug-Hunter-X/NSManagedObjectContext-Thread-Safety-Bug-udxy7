In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with `NSManagedObjectContext` and its interaction with threads.  Specifically, attempting to save changes to the context from a thread other than the one on which it was created can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes. This is because the context is not thread-safe. Consider this code:

```objectivec
- (void)saveContextInBackground:(NSManagedObjectContext *)context {
    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0), ^{ 
        [context save:nil]; // This can cause a crash or unpredictable results
    });
}
```

This code attempts to save the context on a background thread. However, this will likely lead to crashes or inconsistent data.
